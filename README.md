# Semantic Search using Endee Vector Database

## Overview
This project demonstrates a **Semantic Search system** built using **Endee**, a high-performance vector database.  
Text data is converted into embeddings and stored in Endee. Queries are semantically matched using vector similarity.

This project was developed as part of **Endee Labs project-based evaluation**.
