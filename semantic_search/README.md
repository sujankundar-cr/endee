\# Semantic Search using Endee Vector Database



\## Overview

This project demonstrates a \*\*Semantic Search system\*\* built using \*\*Endee\*\*, a high-performance vector database.

Text documents are converted into embeddings and stored in Endee. User queries are embedded and matched using vector similarity.



This project was developed as part of the \*\*Endee Labs project-based evaluation\*\*.
